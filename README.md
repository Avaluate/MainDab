**MainDab is a Roblox exploit that bypasses key systems implemented in Roblox exploit APIs. MainDab works as of June 2025.** 

At the moment, MainDab solely utilises the [WeAreDevs API](https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API). As such, MainDab is essentially a more functional version of WRD's [JJSploit](https://wearedevs.net/d/JJSploit).

MainDab was previously discontinued on April 2023, before a partial resurrection on June 2025. 

Changelog: see [Changelog.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avaluate/MainDab/refs/heads/main/Changelog.txt).
## Download
Go to [releases](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDab/releases) or compile MainDab yourself. Please [read the instructions](https://maindab.gitbook.io/maindabdocs/downloading-maindab) first.
## Is MainDab a virus?
No. MainDab is not obfuscated either; you are free to look at the (shitty) code.

This is explained further in the [help website](https://maindab.gitbook.io/maindabdocs/downloading-maindab/is-maindab-a-virus).
## Can you get banned for Roblox for using exploits?
Yes, but Roblox allows you to exploit [only in your own games](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/an-update-on-automated-action-against-modified-clients/3640609).
## Features
- The key system bypass is what makes MainDab different from other exploits. This process is fully automated
- MainDab also has standard features found in other exploits:
  - A status page showing which APIs are patched by Roblox
  - A nice text editor with syntax highlighting and multiple tabs - MainDab has its [own AvalonEdit definition](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDabWeb/blob/main/Themes/lua_md_default.xshd) specifically for Roblox Lua
  - A [general scripts hub](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDabWeb/blob/main/UpdateStuff/Scripts.json) and a [game hub](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDabWeb/blob/main/UpdateStuff/GameHubScripts.json)
  - [Custom themes](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDabWeb/tree/main/UIThemes) as seen in the cover image
  - Some other tools (i.e. [Multiple Roblox Instances](https://github.com/Avaluate/MultipleRobloxInstances))
