## MainDab Source Code
This is the source code for MainDab's UI. Beware that the code is extremely messy and perhaps even unoptimised. MainDab's UI is made using WPF. 

## Background Information
MainDab is a free Roblox Exploit (Cheat) with multiple APIs to choose from. This is the code for the UI/Frontend itself. It is currently being developed by Avaluate (me). Currently, it's a solo team doing it all.

If you want to join MainDab, you can join the Discord server at https://discord.io/maindab

If you want to contact me on Discord, my tag is `Avaluate#0001` (but remember I will not help you if you want to just copy off the entire MainDab) 

## Can I use this?
Not exactly. You can go on and use some parts of MainDab's Source Code, **but please don't straight off copy the entire exploit.** 

## Great, so how do I get it working?
I'm expecting that you know what you're doing regarding using Visual Studio and that you also have C# experience. I will not be giving any help. 

As a side note, **do NOT use Visual Studio 2022.** Fody has some issues with VS2022. I'm currently using VS2019 for developing MainDab. 

Second, you will need to download [this](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/raw/master/PastebinAPI.dll) and add it as a dependency for MainDab. The rest of the dependencies can be restored via NuGet.

## What does this contain?
This repository contains the MainDab's entire source code. I update this repository everytime I update MainDab. You could just decompile MainDab yourself using DnSpy, ILSpy or any other .NET decompiler, especially if you doubt the credibility (did you really think MainDab is a virus?) of this source code.
