## MainDab has been discontinued
If you do fancy using MainDab's Source Code, then please do go ahead and use it. MainDab is not "free software" per se as it does not cover the requirements needed, but MainDab had always been open sourced in a way that MainDab was never obfuscated in the first place, like what the majority of Roblox exploits do.

## MainDab Source Code
This is the source code for MainDab's UI. Beware that the code is extremely messy and perhaps even unoptimised. There is also a lack of comments within the code. MainDab's UI is made using WPF. A note that the old repository for MainDab got taken down (due to claims of "viruses" within MainDab), and therefore this repository serves as a new link.

MainDab even worked in Linux using Wine

## Can I use MainDab's source code?
Since MainDab is now "archived" in GitHub, yes.

Even though MainDab is technically just out there for anyone to freely copy, it is a general etiquette within the Roblox exploiting community (or more rather any cheating community) to not directly copy an entire project and call it yours. 

If you do want to do copy the entirety of MainDab, then it would always be good if you did credit me. Permission is not needed from me if you wish to use MainDab. You do not need to credit or ask for permission from me if you want to use parts of MainDab's code in your project. 

## Background Information
MainDab is a free Roblox Exploit (or cheat if you call it like that) with multiple APIs to choose from. This repository contains the UI/frontend itself. MainDab was developed by Avaluate (aka me). MainDab actually was a solo project for the majority of its history.

If you want to join MainDab, you can join the Discord server at https://discord.io/maindab (the link will always be valid)

For whatever reason, if you really want to contact me on Discord, my username is `avaluate`. You should also note that I have already "left" the Roblox exploiting community, so you should not really be expecting me to be of much help when it comes to using MainDab or to dealing with Roblox's new anti-tamper.

## Great, so how do I get it working?
You are expected to know what you are doing, alongside having some experience with Visual Studio and C# if you really do want to build MainDab.

If you have any missing dependencies, then you can find them [here](https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDab/tree/main/Dependencies) and add it as a dependency for MainDab. The rest of the dependencies can be restored via NuGet.

If you still have problems with any sort of dependencies (specifically related to building MainDab), Fody may be the issue. Fody has some problems with VS2022, which is why I previously used VS2019 to develop MainDab.
