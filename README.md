## MainDab UI Source Code
This is the source code for MainDab's UI. I think it's pretty self explanatory on where all the files are located, etc. MainDab's UI is made in WPF. In my opinion, this is a pretty nice UI I made... 

## Background Information
MainDab is a Roblox Exploit/Cheat/whatever you want to call it. This is the code for the UI/Frontend itself. It is currently being developed by Main_EX (me), as it's a solo team doing it all.

## Can I contribute? 
Absolutely. If you find anything mildly annoying that you think is worth changing, feel free to make a pull request. 

## Can I use this?
Short answer : Yes.

Long answer : Not exactly. You can go on and use some parts of MainDab's Source Code, **but please don't straight off copy the entire exploit.**

## Great, so how do I get it working?
I'm expecting that you know what you're doing regarding this.

First, **do NOT use Visual Studio 2022.** Fody has some issues there.

Second, you will need to download [this](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/raw/master/PastebinAPI.dll) and add it as a dependency for MainDab. The rest of the dependencies can be restored via NuGet.

## What does this contain?
Again, this contains the code ONLY for MainDab's UI (which is a lot already). I update this repository everytime I update MainDab. Although you could just decompile MainDab yourself using DNSpy or any .NET decompiler, especially if you doubt the credibility of this source code, I've posted the source to GitHub as a sort of way to archive the stuff I do.

The code has been significantly improved on and with more comments added onto it. You are still expected to understand what's going on. You could try to use the source code, and it would be highly appreciated if credits is given.
