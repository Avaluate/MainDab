== MainDab 15.2 REL Released! ==
Build number: 174
Release date: 21 June 2025

Update information
MainDab 15.2 REL is the first update of MainDab since MainDab's last update on 27 April 2023. Many things have since changed in regards to exploiting, and likewise major changes (on the code side of things) have changed. User interface remains mostly untouched.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Removed all exploit APIs, except for WeAreDevs API
‚Ä¢ Fixed link to Discord
‚Ä¢ Fixed bug where attempting to copy a script to clipboard from script hub results in MainDab crashing

Updates
‚Ä¢ Added key bypass system for WeAreDevs API
‚Ä¢ Updated API selection page to properly reflect new changes

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Build number 173 would be the final version of MainDab to be released.

== MainDab 15.1 SP8 Released! ==
Build number: 173
Release date: 27 April 2023

Update information
Fixed some UI bugs and updated Avalon. Other dependencies have also been updated for security reasons.

MainDab update problems
MainDab's auto updater has broken down due to me moving MainDab's assets to another GitHub repo. You MUST redownload MainDab from ‚Å†„Äéüì•„Äèget-maindab. Trust me, this is just a one-time thing.

New documentation
MainDab now has download tutorials for Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, openSUSE and Ubuntu, which make use of Wine to run MainDab. As far as I am aware, there are no other exploits that have any guides for exploiting on Linux (at most just Arch Linux).

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP7 Released! ==
Build number: 172
Release date: Feburary 6 2023

Update information
Added Krnl's API into MainDab as another API for MainDab to use. This is just a small but needed update since other APIs can be quite unreliable.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ None

Updates
‚Ä¢ Added in Krnl's API as requested. Also note that you will need to go through four key systems in order to use Krnl (keys last for 48 hours, I believe)

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP6 Released! ==
Build number: 171
Release date: Feburary 3 2023

Update information
A few rather urgent fixes needed for MainDab. What a concidence that EasyExploits and WeAreDevs BOTH have problems.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Added MainDab's own backup file for WeAreDevs json files. The current WRD mirror on GitHub is not reliable.
‚Ä¢ Added a function where I can remotely enable and disable EasyExploits API from being used in MainDab
‚Ä¢ Fixed the status text settings, it was due to some mispellings I originally made

About EasyExploits API
I could simply just fix the EasyExploits API right now, but I am unsure if I actually need the permission to use Furk Ultra's injection (since that's where EasyExploits work from). EasyExploits API in MainDab is disabled until EasyExploits fixes their injection and no longer demands you to use Furk Ultra.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP5 Released! ==
Build number: 170
Release date: Feburary 21 2023

Update information
Attempt #1 at fixing MainDab "randomly closing". This is possibly linked to a timer that I have running in the background of MainDab that constantly checks for WeAreDevs API status.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP4 Released! ==
Build number: 169
Release date: Feburary 21 2023

Update information
Fixed the WeAreDevs error closing MainDab

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP3 Released! ==
Build number: 168
Release date: January 21 2023

Update information
Since I'm in the process of adding a lot of scripts into the Game Hub, I discovered that I had not thought about memory issues. 44 scripts in the Game Hub would have brought MainDab's total memory usage up to 250mb. I managed to bring down MainDab's total memory usage to ~100mb with the same amount by reducing the image quality.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ I only updated the Game Hub search bar. From now on, you will have to click "search" each time to search for a script, since I couldn't find a way to make that part less laggy.
‚Ä¢ Only the Game Hub has recieved this optimisation update, I'm pioritising adding the rest of the scripts into the Game Hub before I update MainDab.

== MainDab Bootstrapper Update ==
MainDab has recieved a new bootstrapper UI. It looks completely different from the previous bootstrapper, with the new bootstrapper now including a lot more animations.

You can download the bootstrapper and see for yourself here: https://github.com/Avaluate/MainDabWeb/blob/master/MainDabBootstrapper.exe?raw=true (or ‚Å†„Äéüì•„Äèget-maindab)

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP2 Released! ==
Build number: 167
Release date: December 22 2022

Update information
Sorry yet AGAIN for more things that I didn't see coming for MainDab's 15.1 update. I swear this will be the last update for today (3 updates in a row today!)

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Made the script hub images look a bit less weird for custom themes
‚Ä¢ Readded the side bar panel or else custom themes would make MainDab look extremely goofy

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 SP1 Released! ==
Build number: 166
Release date: December 22 2022

Update information
Apparently having a lot of images in the script and game hub would be a bit of an issue. I decided to only load the script and game hub when you actually click on that tab, and not to load it up on startup.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ MainDab no longer takes 10 seconds to start up
‚Ä¢ Fixed the copy script button in game hub crashing MainDab (it was due to a missing animation)

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.1 REL Released! ==
Build number: 165
Release date: December 22 2022

Update information
MainDab finally has a game hub now, plus a search bar for scripts for both the script hub and the game hub. Both of them are still a work in progress, and the script thumbnail images still need to be filled in.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Fixed WeAreDevs API yet AGAIN breaking MainDab for people (there will be a message showing that WRD's website is down)
‚Ä¢ Fixed the topmost toggle button randomly showing a messagebox

Updates
‚Ä¢ The side bar is now animated, and will now indicate which window you are on
‚Ä¢ Some colour schemes (such as text colour) has been fixed
‚Ä¢ The game hub that I've been talking about for so long now exists
‚Ä¢ There's also a search bar for scripts for both the game hub and the script hub (although not the most efficient one codewise!)

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.0 SP7 Released! ==
Build number: 164
Release date: December 5 2022

Update information
Fixes for WeAreDevs API and some Avalon issues

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Fixed MainDab not opening for some people

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.0 SP6 Released! ==
Build number: 163
Release date: October 11 2022

Update information
Just a quick fix for the theme builder.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ Fixed the theme builder's left and right border hex codes

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.0 SP5 Released! ==
Build number: 162
Release date: October 7 2022

Update information
I updated the UI slightly so that custom themes actually look more decent

Updates
‚Ä¢ Changed the icon colours on the execute tab
‚Ä¢ Removed the home page MainDab icon
‚Ä¢ Updated the minimise and close button icon
‚Ä¢ Updated Discord RPC icon

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

== MainDab 15.0 SP4 Released! ==

Build number: 161
Release date: October 4 2022

Update information
I am attempting to somehow "perfect" MainDab's UI in one way or another. What's odd is how only other exploit developers don't really like MainDab's UI. Please remember that I'm the only person working on MainDab.

Fixes/removals
‚Ä¢ WeAreDevs API not injecting has been fixed by updating the API dependency
‚Ä¢ Removed the "Unexpected Client Behaviour" fixer since it no longer works

Updates
‚Ä¢ Side icons slightly changed, tell me if it looks odd or not
‚Ä¢ Replaced the "Get Help" icon with the "Help Centre" icon on the home page
‚Ä¢ Updated the tool tab layout to look less weird
‚Ä¢ Added background images for the scripthub

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.14.2 Released! | Build 145 | 29 January 2022

MainDab is now recieving a new UI! Progress has actually been relatively quick, however I do need your feedback on the new UI. There is no need to redownload MainDab.

Please do leave comments and suggestions on the new UI in #üí°¬¶suggestions. Everything isn't finalised yet. Everything in the new UI is functional, but there is still some work to do.

The following bugs have also been fixed :
- Multiple Roblox crashing MainDab (found making new UI)
- Theme borders looking odd (fixed alongside new UI)

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.14.1 Released! | Build 144 | 26 January 2022
[1] Updated WeAreDevs API due to their new updates (https://wearedevs.net/forum/t/24277)

Oh and I forgot to mention Avalon slightly re-edited BECAUSE IT KEEPS FUCKING BREAKING!!

If I were to use monaco or aceeditor or some shit then MainDab would be bigger, less portable and need webbrowser which means more memory usage

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.14.0 Released! | Build 143 | 1 January 2022
This is an emergency patch for MainDab that I was forced to push. Alongside this however, you might find some hints for a newer, bigger update...

[1] I have now added a patch in MainDab that automatically fixes the "Kicked due to unexpected client behaviour" issue before you inject.
[2] The Autoexec folder is fully functional now. It will automatically execute any scripts in the folder, and it will work with any API.
[3] Avalon is less of a pain now due to a new system (finally!)
[4] Replaced the WRD multiple exploit program with a one I made (#deleted-channel)
[-] Removed Sniff Hub button because we are no longered partnered with them (@LingNYC wanna parther again?). However, Sniff Hub is still in MainDab's script hub.
[-] Removed taint log checks since Roblox doesn't seem to use taint logs to detect exploits anymore.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.13.9 Released! | Build 142 | 8 November 2021
[1] EasyExploits no longer checks for versions, EasyExploits API should work now.

[1] UI changes again, border slightly cleaned up
[2] New theme - Hallow Orange (Halloween Theme for MainDab)
[3] Added in a new API, Anemo API
[4] Improved error messages for EasyExploits and WeAreDevs further
[5] There is now a working autoexec for MainDab

Basically, MainDab now has another free and good API. Anemo API is a new API that replaces the old RBLX API.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.13.7 Released! | Build 140 | 10 October 2021

[1] UI changes again, MainDab is now slightly darker

[3] Fixed EasyExploits and added messages to check if EasyExploits is updated or not
[4] Improved error messages for EasyExploits and WeAreDevs
[-] Removed RBLX API since I realized it won't work

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.13.5 Released! | Build 138 | 1 September 2021

[1] Scripthub changes
[2] Fixed funny border colour

THE SEARCH BAR ON THE SCRIPTHUB DOES NOT WORK, and the image loading isn't perfect either. This will be fixed later.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

[1] Added RobloxHacks/REV API into MainDab, it isn't working at the time of writing this message
[2] Fixed Bug #1 - MainDab crashing when you select the same theme twice
[3] Preparations for further scripthub improvements
[4] Removes funny UI angles
[5] Improved the border 

So new API and a bug fix (check #üî®¬¶bugs for a list of current bugs), I've switched my strategy from updates every month or so to more frequent updates to show I actually care

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.13.3 Released!| Build 136 | 30 August 2021
[1] MainDab's directory is now much clearer thanks to using Fody.Weavers

Just to save time all of MainDab's dependencies are now packed into MainDab, this should significantly reduce the change of some funny errors occurring. As usual, let me know if problems occur.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

MainDab V.13.2 Released! | Build 135 | 29 August 2021
[1] Attempt #1 at preventing MainDab from crashing on startup
[2] Fixed clearbutton
[3] Moved update platform to Github, say goodbye to Pastebin
[4] Fixed scrollbar fucking glitches

THIS UPDATE SHOULD FIX MAINDAB NOT OPENING, CRASHING OR STUCK ON THE LOADING SCREEN WHEN YOU TRY RUN IT. YOU MUST REDOWNLOAD MAINDAB IF YOU ARE HAVING THESE ISSUES. 

Basically I've moved the update platform to Github which should fix MainDab not opening.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

[3] Fixed listbox
[4] Fixed clear button not working
[5] Removed unnecessary references

[1] Moved DLL into new window
[2] More performance stuff changed
[3] Scripthub is bigger, though I haven't moved it to a new window yet
[4] Updated credits

That's pretty much it.

MainDab V.12.4 Released! | Build 127 | 15 May 2021
-- MainDab Executor --
[1] Fixed injection issues, found out it was a single line of code that broke it. This code was supposed to check whether your saved selected options were valid, and changed it to EasyExploits if it wasn't. Turns out that I screwed something up here. I now fixed and tested it, injection should work.

Basically injection fixed, also I'm actually pretty busy this week, just found some time to update it today.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
